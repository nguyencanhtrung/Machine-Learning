===============================
1. What is machine learning?
Two definitions:
- The field of study that gives computers ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
 
- A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if:
It performs a task in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E

===============================
2. Supervised learning problem and Un-supervised learning problem
a. Supervised learning
	- Characteristic:
		Given a dataset for learning in which we have idea about relationship between input and output
		Supervised learning predicts an output of a given input which are not been in the dataset.
	- Categories 	+ Classification problem:  predicts discrete output
			+ Regression problem: predicts continuous output

b. Un-supervised learning 
	- Characteristic:
		Given a dataset for learning, however we have a little or no idea about what a result look like
		Un-supervised learning clusters the data to derive the structure based on relationships among variables in the data
	- Categories 	+ Clustering problem	
			+ Association problem
================================
3. Linear regression with one variable
a. Model Representation
	NOTATION
		m = number of training example 
		x's = "input" variable/features
		y's = "output" variable/ "target" variable
		(x,y) = one training example
